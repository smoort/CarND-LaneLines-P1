Overview
---

This project code that  will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  

The Project
---

The code is written in Jupyter notebook.  If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, check out <A HREF="https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/basics-jupyter-notebook-and-python" target="_blank">Cyrille Rossant's Basics of Jupyter Notebook and Python</A> to get started.

Jupyter is an Ipython notebook where you can run blocks of code and see results interactively.  All the code for this project is contained in a Jupyter notebook. To start Jupyter in your browser, use terminal to navigate to your project directory and then run the following command at the terminal prompt:

`> jupyter notebook`

A browser window will appear showing the contents of the current directory.  Click on the file called "P1.ipynb".  Another browser window will appear displaying the notebook.  You can run the cells to execute the project.  

The writeup.md file has details on the approach and limitations of this solution.
